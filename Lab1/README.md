## Requirements
_LESS CSS_  
you can get it by npm
> npm install -g less


after you can use command to compile LESS-files to CSS
> lessc *input_less_file* *output_css_file*


alternatively you can install watcher that would recompile LESS-files to CSS in live
> npm install -g less-watch-compiler 


to use watcher without configfile you can use this command
> less-watch-compiler *folder_to_watch* *folder_to_output*


here we include config file *less-watch-compiler.config.json* and to use less-watch-compiler you can type
> less-watch-compuler
